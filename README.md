# crossProduct
Computes the cross product of two 3D vectors. Only computes numerical values.

The cross product of two 3D vectors is defined by:

```math
\Large
\langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle \times \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle = \langle u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \rangle
```
